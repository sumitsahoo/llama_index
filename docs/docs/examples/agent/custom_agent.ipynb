    "# Building a Custom Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cookbook we show you how to build a custom agent using LlamaIndex.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The easiest way to build a custom agent is to simply define a stateful function and plug it into `FnAgentWorker`.\n",
    "2. [Optional] Another approach that allows you to peek into our agent abstractions a bit more is to subclass `CustomSimpleAgentWorker` and implement a few required functions. You have complete flexibility in defining the agent step-wise logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lets you add arbitrarily complex reasoning logic on top of your RAG pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "We show you how to build a simple agent that adds a retry layer on top of a RouterQueryEngine, allowing it to retry queries until the task is complete. We build this on top of both a SQL tool and a vector index query tool. Even if the tool makes an error or only answers part of the question, the agent can continue retrying the question until the task is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Any Text-to-SQL application should be aware that executing arbitrary SQL queries can be a security risk. It is recommended to take precautions as needed, such as using restricted roles, read-only databases, sandboxing, etc."

    "## [Optional] Build a Custom Agent through Subclassing\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like, you can also choose to build a custom agent through subclassing the `CustomSimpleAgentWorker`. This is if you want to more heavily customize the mechanisms of our agent interfaces, such as the Task and AgentChatResponse objects and step-wise execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: You probably don't need to read this section for most custom agent flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Refresher\n",
    "\n",
    "An agent in LlamaIndex consists of both an agent runner + agent worker. An agent runner is an orchestrator that stores state like memory, whereas an agent worker controls the step-wise execution of a Task. Agent runners include sequential, parallel execution. More details can be found in our [lower level API guide](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/module_guides/deploying/agents/agent_runner.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most core agent logic (e.g. ReAct, function calling loops), can be executed in the agent worker. Therefore we've made it easy to subclass an agent worker, letting you plug it into any agent runner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Custom Agent Worker Subclass\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above we subclass `CustomSimpleAgentWorker`. This is a class that already sets up some scaffolding for you. This includes being able to take in tools, callbacks, LLM, and also ensures that the state/steps are properly formatted. In the meantime you mostly have to implement the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `_initialize_state`\n",
    "- `_run_step`\n",
    "- `_finalize_task`\n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional notes:\n",
    "- You can implement `_arun_step` as well if you want to support async chat in the agent.\n",
    "- You can choose to override `__init__` as long as you pass all remaining args, kwargs to `super()`\n",
    "- `CustomSimpleAgentWorker` is implemented as a Pydantic `BaseModel` meaning that you can define your own custom properties as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the full set of base properties on each `CustomSimpleAgentWorker` (that you need to/can pass in when constructing your custom agent):\n",
    "- `tools: Sequence[BaseTool]`\n",
    "- `tool_retriever: Optional[ObjectRetriever[BaseTool]]`\n",
    "- `llm: LLM`\n",
    "- `callback_manager: CallbackManager`\n",
    "- `verbose: bool`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `tools` and `tool_retriever` are mutually exclusive, you can only pass in one or the either (e.g. define a static list of tools or define a callable function that returns relevant tools given a user message). You can call `get_tools(message: str)` to return relevant tools given a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these properties are accessible via `self` when defining your custom agent."
